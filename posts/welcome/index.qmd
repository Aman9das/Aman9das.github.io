A warm welcome to my little corner of the internet. Here I will post about random things on my mind. I hope you find some of the posts interesting.

I have been thinking of creating my own site since the last couple of years, but could get around to doing it just now, because of our semester holidays.

The good thing this, though, is that I was comfortable with Quarto for creating various documents, and using it for building the website was very simple.

The last week I had been playing Vampire Survivors mostly, which is a lot of fun. I'll probably be working on the site the next few days.
