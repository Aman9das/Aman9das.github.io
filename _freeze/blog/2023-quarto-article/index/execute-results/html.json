Let HTML be the output format, and toggle **ON** the Use visual markdown editor option.\n-   A new Quarto Document would be created, save it by clicking the Save button in RStudio toolbar[^2].\n\n[^2]: Ctrl+S\n\n## Composition\n\n-   Click the **Render** button in the Document toolbar, a preview webpage of the document would be displayed and refreshed.\n-   The beginning of the file would contain the Document and HTML format [metadata](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) such as Title, Author, Date, CSS theme, etc.\n-   In the document body, you may begin writing and format it afterwards.\n-   To format some text, select it. Click the desired formatting in the Document toolbar such as **Bold**[^3], *Italic*[^4], [Underline]{.underline}, `Code`[^5] etc.\n-   To set a line to be a heading/subheading, select it wholly and click Block Format \\> **Header \\#** in the Document Toolbar.\n\n[^3]: Ctrl+B\n\n[^4]: Ctrl+I\n\n[^5]: Ctrl+D\n\n## Code\n\n-   To embed Code cell/chunk in the Document, navigate to a new line.\n\n-   Select Insert \\> **Executable Cell** \\> language in the Document toolbar.\n\n-   A blank code cell would be created, any code written inside would be run during Document render.\n\n-   The code along with the output produced would displayed in the document. For example:\n\n    ```{{r}}\n\n    n = 100000\n\n    u1 = runif(n)\n    u2 = runif(n)\n\n    z1 = sqrt(-2*log(u1)) * cos(2 * pi * u2)\n    z2 = sqrt(-2*log(u1)) * sin(2 * pi * u2)\n\n    plot(density(c(z1, z2)))\n    ```\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n-   The code may be [hidden](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#hiding-code) or [folded](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#folding-code) too.\n\n## Miscellaneous Tips\n\n-   Insert/create tables using the **Table** Document toolbar item.\n\n-   Embed links by selecting the hypertext and clicking the **Link..**[^6] button in toolbar. Provide the URL to open if the hypertext is clicked.\n\n-   Latex content may be inserted via the Insert \\> **Latex Math** option.\n\n[^6]: Ctrl+K\n\n## Further Reading\n\n-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)\n\n-   [RMarkdown Syntax](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)\n\n-   [Other Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)\n",
