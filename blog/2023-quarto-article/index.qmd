This tutorial will get you started with writing Quarto Documents and Presentations using RStudio

## Pre-requisites

-   A Personal Computer.
-   [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
-   Familiarity with Word Processors.[^1]

[^1]: Using the toolbar/menubar, saving, formatting and other basic tasks.

## Creating a New Document

-   Open RStudio Desktop on the Computer.
-   In the **File** menu, select **New File** \> **Quarto Document**.
-   In the New Quarto Document dialog box, provide the Title and Author name of the Document. Let HTML be the output format, and toggle **ON** the Use visual markdown editor option.
-   A new Quarto Document would be created, save it by clicking the Save button in RStudio toolbar[^2].

[^2]: Ctrl+S

## Composition

-   Click the **Render** button in the Document toolbar, a preview webpage of the document would be displayed and refreshed.
-   The beginning of the file would contain the Document and HTML format [metadata](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) such as Title, Author, Date, CSS theme, etc.
-   In the document body, you may begin writing and format it afterwards.
-   To format some text, select it. Click the desired formatting in the Document toolbar such as **Bold**[^3], *Italic*[^4], [Underline]{.underline}, `Code`[^5] etc.
-   To set a line to be a heading/subheading, select it wholly and click Block Format \> **Header \#** in the Document Toolbar.

[^3]: Ctrl+B

[^4]: Ctrl+I

[^5]: Ctrl+D

## Code

-   To embed Code cell/chunk in the Document, navigate to a new line.

-   Select Insert \> **Executable Cell** \> language in the Document toolbar.

-   A blank code cell would be created, any code written inside would be run during Document render.

-   The code along with the output produced would displayed in the document. For example:

    ```{{r}}

    n = 100000

    u1 = runif(n)
    u2 = runif(n)

    z1 = sqrt(-2*log(u1)) * cos(2 * pi * u2)
    z2 = sqrt(-2*log(u1)) * sin(2 * pi * u2)

    plot(density(c(z1, z2)))
    ```

    ```{r echo=FALSE}

    n = 100000

    u1 = runif(n)
    u2 = runif(n)

    z1 = sqrt(-2*log(u1)) * cos(2 * pi * u2)
    z2 = sqrt(-2*log(u1)) * sin(2 * pi * u2)

    plot(density(c(z1, z2)))
    ```

-   The code may be [hidden](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#hiding-code) or [folded](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#folding-code) too.

## Miscellaneous Tips

-   Insert/create tables using the **Table** Document toolbar item.

-   Embed links by selecting the hypertext and clicking the **Link..**[^6] button in toolbar. Provide the URL to open if the hypertext is clicked.

-   Latex content may be inserted via the Insert \> **Latex Math** option.

[^6]: Ctrl+K
